Gratitude
-------
I'd like to show my immense gratitude to the following: 

*   Jack from 1a23
    That boy advised me to make a web-based console for my site, and provided me with much resource to form the concept.
*   Hello World _(Yes, that's his name.)_  
    His planning to make a cloud OS with hardly not knowing anything about client-side programming encouraged me to construct my own one in assist of him.

_(P.S. I suddenly feel the default coloring looks like T-Mobile... My illusion?)_
