Cos Introduction v0.1
==============================

Foreword
--------
I've been dreaming about my own OS style ever since 13, and after Consora was invented, it seems to be the right time to make my dream come true.

###Previous constructions
Before my constructing this Cos, I tried:

*   [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/), which is an excellent touch for advanced Linux users to go deeper in the ocean of Linux.
*   [PythonOS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tslmy/), a Python-based OS console simulator in Python, made as a practice. It even had a unique file system!
*   [ArchLinux](http://www.archlinux.org), which ended up in mess.
*   Several virtual machines. I even tried replace `explorer.exe` with my `PythonOS.py` console to console myself.
